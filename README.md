# FindFlights

## Overview:
The "FindFlights" application is designed for iOS platforms, aiming to simplify the flight search process for users. By providing necessary details such as the departure airport, arrival airport, travel date, and passenger count, users can effortlessly fetch available flights tailored to their preferences.

## Features:
### Input Fields: User-friendly forms to input details like origin, destination, departure date, and passenger counts (adults, teen, children).

### Station List Search: A robust search functionality allows users to search for stations either by the airport code or name, simplifying the selection process for origin and destination fields.

### Date Picker: An intuitive in-house built date picker ensures users can select their desired departure date with ease.

### Picker/Increment Controls: For a seamless experience, we've added picker/increment controls for selecting the number of adults, teens, and children, ensuring accurate passenger count.

### Search Results: Once details are filled, a simple click on the search button fetches flight details. Results display essential information, including the flight date, flight number, and the regular fare.

### Unit Testing: Comprehensive unit test cases have been written for both Models and ViewModels, ensuring the application's robustness and reliability.

## Dependencies:
TravelDatePicker: Our custom-built date picker component, separated for modularity and reusability, enhancing the user experience by providing a seamless date selection process.
FindFlightsInputField: A reusable input field component we developed to maintain consistency and streamline the design across the app.

## No Third-Party Dependencies:
